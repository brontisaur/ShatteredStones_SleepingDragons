\chapter{Crystal}

\lettrine{Tiffany} narrowed her eyes skeptically at the crystal. 
Her long, slender fingers twirled it around and around in the light.
No imperfections were revealed in either the magelight or candlelight.
None that should have this outsized impact on her circuit anyway. 
The sunslight would be no use.

The false day was still young when the last fellow student left the laboratory, but now it was truly twilight.
A small part of Tiffany dismissively insulted the beautiful stretching golden and pink hues that accompanied the setting of Sol Priori. 
Even the twin suns themselves can have no say in when she decides to finish her work.\\

Especially if they would decide to be useless to her task in doing so.\\

Sunslight would usually have been her final, desperate bid with which to find any crystal imperfections. 
Unfortunately, she could not progress to that check this time.\\

Perhaps Sol Priori could have a say in when she would be finished.\\

Or, perhaps, she could stop hyper-focusing on this particular crystal and just pick up another one instead.\\

Tiffany looked across her workbench at the seemingly infinitely stretching [Name] Laboratory.
It was not truly infinite.
It was just a long room.
The several rows of identically spaced workbenches across the length of it did make it appear \textit{longer} than it truly was, however.\\

Or would the workbenches make it appear shorter? They should, technically, especially since they were placed nearly from wall to wall in the width of the laboratory.\\

Tiffany sighed at the sight of the crystal dispensers mounted along the wall to her left.
Dizzying quantities of quartz were haphazardly sorted into baskets by some system of size, grading, colour... imperfection rating...\\

Her attention returned to the crystal she was turning over in her fingers.
Any progress made, no matter how false or misdirected, would be lost the moment she chose another.
Those categories were guesses at best -- and pure lies mostly. 
Tiffany has no idea \textit{how} the imperfection ratings were truly arrived at, since the deviation from reality was so strong. 
They were practically useless as a design consideration.\\

Perhaps it was her alone that was always blessed with an incorrect imperfection rating.
No other student at the School of Alchemy of the University of Grosberg had such \textit{luck} as she.\\

The magelight flickered to life as the magelamps slowly lit themselves in tandem with the final retreating rays of Sol Priori.\\

``Oh.''\\

Tiffany could have kicked herself.\\

The crystal imperfections were not the problem. 
The rating was correct.

A very clear band of white through the rose of the quartz crystal told her all she needed to know.\\

If she had thought to turn on the main magelights of the laboratory in the lab earlier, before Sol Priori began to set, Tiffany would have known that this crystal was the incorrect colour.\\

``Sorry, Sol Priori, it was not your fault after all.'' Tiffany breathed as a defeated sigh guided her hands to cover her face.\\

The magelights were not to blame either, she was yet to apologise to them too.
What could have posessed her to miss this stripe? 
Everything inside her convinced her that this was the correct crystal to choose.\\

Why...

``Wait,'' she mused to herself as she glanced over at her design, crystal still turning over in her fingers.\\

``It \textit{is} the right one... I need the white band... why...''\\

Tiffany halted when her eyes fell on the amplifier lying in pieces in front of her. The catalyst
