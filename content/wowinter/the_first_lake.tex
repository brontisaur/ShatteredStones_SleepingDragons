\section{On another lonely night in Grosbergan, Tiffany Receives her Letter of Acceptance to the Scope Program}

Tiffany was accustomed to the silence, in general.
A night like this, especially, created a familiar expectation for it.
It suited her.
That is what she told herself: she was suited to silence.\\

Anyone else would scoff at that thought, had they truly known her.

The heft in her palm and the lack of internal cracks at first glance when she held it up to the light told her that this might just be the one.
Tiffany's light boots barely touched the floor as she flitted back to her workbench.
Though, where her steps made little to no noise, the knocking of the stool as she carelessly pulled it from beneath the workbench certainly did.\\

Precariously perched atop the stool, Tiffany grabbed the finelight closer.
Her eyeglass lenses slid down over their frames with a nod of her head.
The fine details of the crystal in her hands came into larger view --- as did an annoyingly red reflection of an escaped curl before her face.
The sensation of the hair secured at the base of her neck slowly pulling from its haphazardly fashioned governance was beginning to feel irksome.
